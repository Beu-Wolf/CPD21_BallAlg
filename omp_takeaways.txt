WITH TASKS:
 - Only using tasks reduced time from 11.0 seconds to 4.9
 - setting a depth of n_points = 2 to stop the creation of tasks shaves 0.1 seconds
 - adding a taskloop to find square distances does no improve time
 - adding more taskloops in some easy to parallelize functions does no improve
    - Added in calculate square distances (line 135)
    - Added in find_furthest_points (lines 201, 217)
    - Added in calc_orth_projs (line 236)
 - created custom max reduction function, might be usefull

 TODO:
 Explore not using tasks, but using multiple parallel sections and forking/joining them
 Explore nested parallellism, however professor didn't seem to keen on it idk
