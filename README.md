# CPD21_BallAlg
Project for the course Parallel and Distributed Computing, 
This project consisted of parallelizing a given algorithm, that calculated a Ball-Tree data structure, usefull for the kNN Machine Learning algorithm.

The project had 2 stages, parallelizing the program to both OpenMP first and MPI second.

Done with my friends [Afonso](https://github.com/afonsocrg) and [Marcelo](https://github.com/tosmarcel)
